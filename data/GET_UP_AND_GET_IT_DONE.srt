1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
The longest time in the world is the hesitation between thought and action.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,800
It can actually be forever.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,000
You can hesitate for one second to get started on something, a workout, a project, a task,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,400
something that you know you should do.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
You can hesitate for one second.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,520
That one second of hesitation also turns into five seconds and then ten seconds and

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,120
then ten minutes.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,400
And in just like that, you drifted into the eternity zone.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,000
One second became an eternity because something that was going to happen is now never going

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to happen.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ever.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,480
Why is that because you hesitated?

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,000
So don't take that chance instead, take action.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,640
A body in motion tends to stay in motion.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,600
A body at rest tends to stay at rest.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,000
You've had enough damn rest.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
You've got to get to the point in your life where you decide I have had it.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm tired of being a loser.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,400
I got tired of losing.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,920
I got tired of coming up short.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,720
I got tired.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,600
I want to move to the nicest neighborhood.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
I want to fly first class.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,720
I want to go to Hawaii.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,960
I made a decision, enough is enough.

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
It's show time.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,320
In order for you to go from one level to the next level, in order for any woman to transition,

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,600
for any man to transition, the thing that they want must be greater than the thing they

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,120
currently have.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Humans do not transition to another level when they comfortable with the level that they're

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
on.

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,320
You only go to another level when you say, enough is enough.

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,400
I want you to live the life you were meant to live.

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
You hear me?

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,160
Not the life that was given to you.

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,520
You deserve to see what your life would look like if you gave a hundred and twenty percent.

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,520
And what I need you to do is I need you to look at yourself and the men say, come on,

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
stop playing.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,960
I deserve to see what my life would look like if I gave a hundred and twenty percent.

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
That's a lie, I'm old.

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,480
You got to get to a place where you start executing.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,120
Making a freaking plan is the easy part.

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,080
And you have to understand if you don't execute on the plan, if you don't get up in the

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,880
morning when you're feeling tired, scared, if you don't execute, you're not just cheating

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,280
yourself, dude.

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,880
You're cheating your family.

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,720
You're cheating your employees.

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,640
You're cheating your team, whatever you're a part of.

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,280
It's bigger than you, man.

50
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
And guess what?

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,240
I had to get up even though it was hard and I had to take ownership of my life, take

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,560
ownership of my time, take ownership of my day.

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,120
And those of you who messed up why?

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Because you don't understand, think, act, eat, rest.

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,280
We talked about a schedule.

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
I realized that my strength is in my routine.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why?

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Because I'm not as strong as I thought I was.

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not as intelligent as I thought I was.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,400
And my routine is what I do every day, repeatedly.

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,720
The DNA of your successes in your routine, you're not as deep as you think you are.

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
You've got a fun routine.

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm getting up at three and stick with it.

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm getting up at five and stick with it.

65
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,960
Yeah, I have 365 days where I'm a bad dad too.

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,840
But I'm trying to tell you, the strength is in the routine.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,240
Find a routine and stick with it.

68
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
No one dreamin' it.

69
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Dreamin' is over.

70
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
I mean specifics.

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,960
What are you doin' on Monday?

72
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,240
What are you doin' on Tuesday?

73
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,880
What are you doin' on Wednesday?

74
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,640
You need to be very specific.

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,680
It's time to put yo' eastern together of your puzzle.

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,840
Nobody gave me this iron dish.

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,040
Life wasn't a crystal stare for me.

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,600
Didn't nobody give me a network?

79
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
I earned a network.

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
I worked my way to the NBA.

81
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,920
I worked my way to the NFL.

82
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,120
Everybody say, he, how did you crack the code?

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,040
I climbed it my way through the code.

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
That's how I cracked it.

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,200
I got up every day at three.

86
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't care what the economy is doing.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
I don't care who the president is.

88
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,240
Nobody helped me to get here.

89
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,400
I had to get up.

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
I had to go to class.

91
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,760
I had to read.

92
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
I had to study.

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
I had to write.

94
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,360
I understood that the dream is real,

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
but the lifestyle is realer.

96
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,320
It doesn't matter what everybody else is doing.

97
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,960
Stay predictable.

98
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,440
Stay consistent.

99
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
And the reason why many of you are not getting it

100
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,080
is because you're not consistent.

101
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,760
You start and you stop.

102
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,920
You get pumped up.

103
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
You start strong.

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,680
And then somewhere in the middle, you quit.

105
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,040
You have a little success,

106
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,240
but you don't experience exponential growth

107
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
because you're not consistent.

108
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,720
You gotta be persistent.

109
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,280
You gotta be locked in.

110
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,040
You can't score more watch.

111
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
So many of you score more watch it.

112
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
Every time you do something,

113
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,720
you're looking up to see the score.

114
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,560
You stop and work in to look at yourself.

115
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
You're not grinding.

116
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
You glaring.

117
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,520
You should be grinding it.

118
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,600
You're looking at the score.

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
The score is what it is.

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
The score ain't about the change

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
because you looked at it.

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,120
Keep playing the game.

123
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
Keep grinding.

124
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,400
Keep marking.

125
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,960
And that other stuff will take care of itself.

126
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm challenging you to get from where you are.

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm challenging you to stop settling.

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,640
I'm challenging you to stop accepting

129
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,120
the life that was given to you.

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,440
I'm challenging you to give 120%.

131
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,400
If you don't do what you say you don't do,

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,880
be what you say you don't be,

133
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,440
you're gonna have to lie on me out.

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,520
You're a gazelle.

135
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,800
You're gonna come up short.

136
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,760
You're a gazelle.

137
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,640
You're not always gonna get what you want outta life.

138
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,720
You're a gazelle.

139
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,560
You don't have an average experience.

140
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,600
You were soon, I knew you were lying, More.

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,760
You were teacher, I knew you were lying, More.

142
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,120
You were not your manure, I knew you were lying, More.

143
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,400
You try to lose weight, lie, More.

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,480
You can't do nothing significant in gazelle, More.

145
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Nothing.

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
Nothing impressive happens in gazelle, More.

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
Nothing happening, run, More.

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,240
Give up, More.

149
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,080
Quit, More.

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,920
Scared, More.

151
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
Seared from, More.

152
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Nothing happens.

153
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,040
Everything happening, lie, More.

154
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,480
Like I'm coming to get you.

155
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,200
You constantly trade on this opportunity.

156
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,840
You don't worry about tomorrow.

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,360
You constantly trade on this opportunity

158
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,040
with all your might, with all your soul, with all your heart.

159
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,720
You focus on this and tomorrow we'll take care of itself.
